## What's this "Dolos" thing?

Dolos is a simple little script (dependencies included) that will install and
configure PuTTY and Google Chrome in one go.

It's meant to be used when you're at a public computer (typically one which
will have its contents wiped as soon as you log off) running Windows, and you
want to do some work remotely with SSH without having to install a bunch of
stuff every time you log in.

## Great! How do I get started?

Simple. Download the ZIP archive off the GitHub repository page, extract it
into its own folder **(important!)**, and then double-click `install.cmd`.

That's about it!

## License

MIT. Dependencies each have their own licenses, which are available in the
`deps` folder.
